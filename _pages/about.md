<p style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold;">Hello, I'm <b>Neha</b> 👋</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">I am a Data Scientist and AI researcher with 2+ years of experience in applied machine learning and AI-driven systems. I hold a Master’s in Data Science from the UK and have led projects that combine ML research, cloud deployment, and practical AI solutions. My work focuses on developing innovative machine learning models, conducting rigorous research, and translating complex data into actionable insights.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
   My goal is to connect research with real-world applications, building AI systems that are both efficient and scalable.
